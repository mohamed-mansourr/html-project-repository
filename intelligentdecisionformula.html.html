<h3 style="background-color:floralwhite;">Intelligent Decision Formula</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Save the result of all actions</li>
  <li>Simulate all possible outcomes</li>
  <li>Compare the new action with the old ones</li>
  <li>Check if the new action is good or bad</li>
  <li>Choose the new action if it is less bad</li>
  <li>Do it all over again</li>
</ul>
The fact that computers can do this millions of times, has proven that computers can take very intelligent desicions.

<h3 style="background-color:floralwhite;">Introduction to Decision Intelligence</h3>

<p style="background-color:lightgrey;">Curious to know what the psychology of avoiding lions on the savannah has in common with responsible AI leadership and the challenges of designing data warehouses? Welcome to decision intelligence!
Decision intelligence is a new academic discipline concerned with all aspects of selecting between options. It brings together the best of applied data science, social science, and managerial science into a unified field that helps people use data to improve their lives, their businesses, and the world around them. It’s a vital science for the AI era, covering the skills needed to lead AI projects responsibly and design objectives, metrics, and safety-nets for automation at scale.
Let’s take a tour of its basic terminology and concepts. The sections are designed to be friendly to skim-reading (and skip-reading too, that’s where you skip the boring bits… and sometimes skip the act of reading entirely).</p>

<h3 style="background-color:floralwhite;">What’s a decision?</h3>

<p style="background-color:lightgrey;">Data are beautiful, but it’s decisions that are important. It’s through our decisions — our actions — that we affect the world around us.
We define the word “decision” to mean any selection between options by any entity, so the conversation is broader than MBA-style dilemmas (like whether to open a branch of your business in London).
In this terminology, appending a label such as cat versus not-cat to a user’s photo is a decision executed by a computer system, while figuring out whether to launch that system is a decision taken thoughtfully by the human leader (I hope!) in charge of the project.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:floralwhite;">What’s a decision-maker?</h3>

<p style="background-color:lightgrey;">In our parlance, a “decision-maker” is not that stakeholder or investor who swoops in to veto the machinations of the project team, but rather the person who is responsible for decision architecture and context framing. In other words, a creator of meticulously-phrased objectives as opposed to their destroyer.</p>
